- 👋 Hi all, I’m @Trevin-Small

- 🔥 Checkout my latest project! https://www.werms-nfts.com/ 

- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything STEM. 
     I have a background in VEX robotics and have built various kinds of robots, including combat ones (Not really robots, but really fun.) 
     I love working with both software and hardware together with MCU's. I also enjoy 3D printing and cooking. 
     My latest interest is in Cryptocurrencies and NFT's.
    
- 🌱 I will be a Freshman at Purdue University in West Lafayette in the fall of 2021!
     I am majoring in computer science, and I plan to take part in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence focus track in my upper-classmen studies.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NFT's. If you have an idea you're looking to launch, contact me!
