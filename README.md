## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University, graduating winter 24'

  - Interested in OS/RTOS, efficient memory management, assembly optimization, and computer architecture.
  - Algorithms and Mathematics, because working through problems is fun!
  - Web development! Currently working on the redesign of the well-known [boilerexams](https://boilerexams.com) website at Purdue.
