- 👋 Hi all, I’m @Trevin-Small

- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and most things STEM. 
     I have a background in VEX robotics (Team 9922Z & 7870E) and have built various other robots.
     I love working with MCU's like Arduino, and my favorite projects are those that involve both hardware and software. I also enjoying cooking and running.
    
- 🌱 I will be beginning my studies at Purdue University in West Lafayette in fall 2021!
     I am majoring in computer science, and I plan to take part in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence focus track in my upper-classmen studies.
