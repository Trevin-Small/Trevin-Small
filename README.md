## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University, graduating winter 24'
- I truly love computer science! It's definitely my biggest passion. Whenever I'm not working on Comptuer Science homework/projects, I am usually learning about CS anyways.
- When I'm not climbing, I'm often writing code, usually engulfed in a personal project that distracts me from my schoolwork.
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and mechatronics projects, usually involving MCU's. Also, did I mention climbing?
### I'm especially interested in:
  - Systems and embedded programming. I think lower-level software is incredibly fascinating, and I love OS's, memory management, hardware interaction and computer architecture.
  - Algorithms and Mathematics. Working through problems is satisfying, and I enjoy finding clever solutions to tough problems.
  - Web development, especially in regard to making web apps more interactive and interesting (why are so many websites cookie cutter layouts? I like more visually interesting pages...)

## 😄 Other Interests / Hobbies
- Rock Climbing
- Cooking
- 3D Printing
- Microcontrollers, Single-board computers and circuits
- Robotics
