- 👋 Hi all, I’m @Trevin-Small
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics and most things STEM. I have a background in VEX robotics (Team 9922Z & 7870E) and have built various other robots, such as a 3lb combat robot.
I love working with MCU's like Arduino, and my favorite projects are those that involve both hardware and software.
- 🌱 I’m currently in high school, but I wll be studying Computer Science at Purdue University in West Lafayette in fall 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (I don't know yet! I'm still learning.)
- 📫 How to reach me: trevincub03@gmail.com
