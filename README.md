- 👋 Hi all, I’m @Trevin-Small

- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything STEM. 
     I have a background in VEX robotics (Team 9922Z & 7870E) and have built various kinds of robots, including combat ones. 
     I love working with software, but I have experience with hardware too, especially MCU's like Arduino and SBC's like RPI. I also enjoy 3D printing and cooking. 
     My latest interest is in Cryptocurrencies and NFT's.
    
- 🌱 I will be beginning my studies at Purdue University in West Lafayette in fall 2021!
     I am majoring in computer science, and I plan to take part in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence focus track in my upper-classmen studies.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (I don't know yet! I'm still learning...)
