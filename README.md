## 🙋‍♂️  About Me
- Currently a full time CS student at Purdue University, graduating winter 24'
- I truly love computer science! It's definitely my biggest passion. Whenever I'm not working on Comptuer Science homework/projects, I am usually learning about CS anyways.
- When I'm not climbing, I'm often writing code, usually engulfed in a personal project that distracts me from my schoolwork.
- Outside of CS, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and mechatronics projects, usually involving MCU's. Also, did I mention climbing?
### I'm especially interested in:
  - Systems and embedded programming. I love low level software and programming physical devices like ESP32 and Arduino. I'm interested in OS's, memory management, hardware interaction and computer architecture.
  - Algorithms and Mathematics, because working through problems is fun!
  - Web development, especially when making pages that are more visually interesting than run-of-the-mill sites.

## 😄 Other Interests / Hobbies
- Rock Climbing
- Cooking
- Microcontrollers, Single-board computers and circuits
- Robotics
- 3D Printing
